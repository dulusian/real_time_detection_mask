# real_time_detection_mask
Real time detection of properly masked, improperly masked, and no-masked.

In the deep learning course, I was in a team of three which we worked on coming up with a model to detect people wearing masks correctly, incorrectly, or without masks.
We used PyTorch for the main model and implementation.
